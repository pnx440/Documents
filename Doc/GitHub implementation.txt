Push file from local
https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line

Delete Files
In the command-line, navigate to your local repository.
Ensure you are in the default branch:
git checkout master
The rm -r command will recursively remove your folder:
git rm -r folder-name
Commit the change:
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
Push the change to your remote repository:
git push origin master

Remote origin already exists on 'git push' to a new repository

METHOD1->

Since origin already exist remove it.

git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
METHOD2->

One can also change existing remote repository URL by ->git remote set-url

If you're updating to use HTTPS

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
If you're updating to use SSH

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
If trying to update a remote that doesn't exist you will receive a error. So be careful of that.

METHOD3->

Use the git remote rename command to rename an existing remote. An existing remote name, for example, origin.

git remote rename origin startpoint
# Change remote name from 'origin' to 'startpoint'
To verify remote's new name->

git remote -v
